### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This base model is the first implementation of the *NormAN* framework. NormAN – short for Normative Argument Exchange across Networks – is a framework for agent-based modelling of argument exchange in social networks, first presented in Assaad et.al, (2023). A detailed explanation of the base model and its parameters can be found there.

NormAN is a NetLogo model of argument exchange between Bayesian agents about a particular hypothesis. It comprises three components: a ‘world’ model, individual agents, and a social network. NormAN's base model offers the user the possibility to change each of these components and thus explore a variety of different argumentation scenarios.
* The world model consists of a Bayesian network which determines the true state of the hypothesis, along with the truth values of so-called evidence propositions connected to said hypothesis.
* Agents receive evidence about that world (through inquiry) and may communicate that evidence to others as arguments and receive it in turn. Agents aggregate all evidence/arguments that they have encountered to form a degree of belief in the target claim. To this end, they use Bayes’ rule.
* Communication, finally, takes place across a social network.


### HOW TO GET STARTED

This model was developed in **NetLogo 6.2.1** (freely available for download [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.1/)) and relies on NetLogo’s R extension (for an explanation, see [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.2/docs/r.html)). As of Nov 2023, it is important that one uses a *6.2.X* version of NetLogo because the R extension does not work reliably for versions *6.3* and above. Specifically, the model uses bnlearn, an R package for Bayesian network learning and inference (explained [here](https://www.bnlearn.com/)). The R Extension comes bundled with NetLogo *6* and requires a compatible R installation on your device. R is freely available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/), and you can learn more about the details of using R with NetLogo in NetLogo's [documentation](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.2/docs/r.html) under Section *Installing*. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any problems running NormAN.

### HOW TO USE

Follow these steps to quickly initialize the model: 

1. When first opening the model, make sure ‘reset-world-?’ and ‘reset-social-network-?’ are on.
2. The World: choose a ‘causal-structure’ (chooser).
3. The social network: choose a ‘social-network’ (chooser) and a ‘number-of-agents’ (slider).
4. Click setup: the social network will appear in the interface, the right bottom monitor will show a histogram of agent-beliefs and the middle output will show which pieces of evidence are true.
5. Press ‘go’ to start the simulation. 
 
By clicking ‘setup’, users can wholly re-initialize the model, or keep some model facets fixed. Switching ‘reset-world-?’ on resets the truth values of the evidence nodes when ‘ setup’ is pressed. ‘reset-social-network-?’ resets all agents and the social network that connects them. ‘reset-agents-initial-evidence-?’ resets the set of evidence
that each agent starts with upon initialization (only relevant if initial-draws>0). Note that because these facets are interconnected, ‘reset-world-?’ triggers ‘reset-social-network-?’, and so does ‘reset-social-network-?’. 

If you would like to monitor what each agent does each round, toggle ‘show-me-?’ on each agent will output their exact step-by-step behaviour as lines in the Command Center. 

The ‘plotting-type’ chooser gives three options for visualizing the frequency of shared arguments (in the plot entitled ‘The rise and fall of arguments’): ‘uttered’ tracks how many times a piece of evidence has been shared each round. ‘sent-to’ tracks how many agents an argument was sent to. ‘received-as-novel’ tracks how many times an argument was received as a novelty by an agent.
